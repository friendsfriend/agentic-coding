# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Orchestrator can shape workflows with blueprints

The orchestrator principal SHALL be allowed to read the blueprint step catalog,
validate blueprints, and start blueprint workflows. Blueprint starts from the
orchestrator SHALL keep the human-review gate pin and SHALL count toward the
orchestrator launch limits. The orchestrator session SHALL be offered tools for
these operations and SHALL never submit a manifest directly.

#### Scenario: Orchestrator validates then starts

- **WHEN** the orchestrator validates a blueprint and then starts it
- **THEN** the started workflow SHALL pin the validated digest
- **AND** its plan, developer and wiki gates SHALL be pinned `always`

#### Scenario: Review-free blueprint

- **WHEN** the orchestrator starts a blueprint that bypasses developer review
- **THEN** the server SHALL refuse it with the compiler's diagnostic
