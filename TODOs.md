Not for agents. This is only for humans.

Fixes: 
* Test verifier is missing from the agents panel in the dashboard -> on the second run it was there

Big ones:
* Agent steered version of the workflow. Basically an orchestrator version of the workflow.
* subagent system for workers
* Make otel work for apps that are launched via the environment as well (Introduce Agent skill for setup)
* Agent skills to create the environments for a fresh app.

Small ones: 
* (Maybe) Give all agents their own tab. Multitab spawning always has issues for some reason
* Improve agent steering based on recent runs (observability first)
* Dependency upgrades
